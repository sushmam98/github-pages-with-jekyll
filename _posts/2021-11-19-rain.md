  Weather forecast said that there would be heavy rains for 3 continuous days. But how much can you rely on the weather forecast? They are almost always wrong right? Wrong!
This time they seem to be Bang on right. It's been past 3 days and it's still raining. What exactly might me the cause of these heavy down pours? Scientists say that it's because of the depressions caused by the cyclones in the Bay of Bengal. The rate of the number of cyclones originating is increasing with time. What exactly is the cause of these continuous set of cyclones that are coming uninvited these past few years? Not knowing the answers we turned to our amazing scientists. Well, scientists say that global warming is the cause of all this havoc.

  We can see that the cause is nothing but our initial problem, "Global Warming". This problem which wasn't that significant has now started to get severe. We really need to do something about it. It's time that we took a stand to stop global warming, climate change and everything that is going against our laws of nature. Climate change and global warming is not just a topic for debate. It is very much real and it is affecting us and our future. 
  
  It's time that we said no to cutting down trees. It's time we started preserving our natural rivers. It's time we started saying no to plastics. It's time we started raising our voice against everything that is going wrong.
